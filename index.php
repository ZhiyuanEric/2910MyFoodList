                            This website was created by a team of 6 developers for our Comp 2910 Projects course.  Our main goal in this project is to bring awareness to how much food one can potentially waste in <span id="easterRain">Metro Vancouver</span>.  Through our web application, our intended idea is to combine several people's preferences together to see how a meal can be better prepared.
